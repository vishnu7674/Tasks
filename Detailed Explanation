## Steps to Deploy

1. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform and apply the commands to create the resources

terraform init
terraform apply

2. Build and Push Docker Image , actually in our organisation we use JFROG 

docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/static-web-app:latest .
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/static-web-app:latest

2. Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply

3. Deploy Application to Kubernetes Cluster GKE

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml

1)if you get any issues while deploying,first check the image whether it is pulling or not
2)Next if everything is good means about image means and still getting error means .
3)DO describe and check the logs command , maximum time we get answers while doing this
4)if service is not working means , check the svc and get the endpoints , whether it is going in crt way or not
5)If a node has a taint means, pods won't schedule unless we tolerate the taint

5. Access the Application

kubectl get svc static-web-service
	Access the web app in your browser using the external IP.
